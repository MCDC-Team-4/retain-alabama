I've worked in stores, and people are not welcoming at all. They are not open minded or inclusive. I have been threatened, harassed, and, the store I was at at the time, was robbed. I understand this is not an accurate picture of the state as a whole. However, It has surely soured my feelings towards the state when these things keep happening.    It's very conservative as well, and I don't believe that, as a woman, I would be able to receive medical care that I need without judgment by professionals.     Also, in music education at least, most positions in Alabama require you to be at multiple schools. This state does not care about the arts. It's obvious, and I do not want to spend my career fighting that battle. Especially when I could go to another state, and not have so much on plate for the same job.     Public safety is a priority for me, and I have personally been let down by law enforcement multiple times in the past five years here. Maybe that is just in Jacksonville.

I am by no means a ""leftist"" but I see this state being held back repeatedly by corruption and an insidious toxic culture that festers at all levels of government and society. We can do better. There are amazing humans here with loads of potential, but we must recognize how to care for one another. Once our people are taken care of our future will be brighter. Children will grow up in safer healthier environments. Our people will give back and put more effort into pushing themselves and the community forward, especially when they're not living hand to mouth, and given more opportunities to thrive instead of just survive. We must do better and stop being complacent with being a national/global joke- clinging to a false image of tradition and skewed conservative values.",1,Alabama,9,2,1,White,4,3,0,1

However, I would say there are some cultural and political problems within the state, A large minority of the state boasts their lack of education/reasoning skills, many of these people are good people but I believe politics have consumed a majority of their beliefs as simple things such as education have been completely polarized. The partisanship expressed by many inhabitants is unhealthy to the state, I even have a large majority of my family that will call you a communist for supporting any policy that isn't a Republican view. I believe this severely hampers the states ability to flourish as the state is slowly becoming an echo chamber of anti-democrat views(I'm talking views that don't even have to help our citizens but can simply harm non-republicans). I do not believe either party is 100% correct on every policy and I believe there are many arcane and failed policies retained by the state just because the alternative my be seen as democratic policy. For example, I believe that the criminalization of marijuana is a failed policy as it has done nothing to benefit the lives of the citizens of the state and has only proved to benefit the revenue system of the courts. Having grown up here my whole life I can with 100% certainty say that the current system has not dampered the use of marijuana(even among teens as in highschool it was easier to purchase marijuana than alcohol(p.s. Criminals don't care who they sell to, Businesses do)) We have severely hampered all the tax revenue that comes from the sale of marijuana because it now goes unreported. I feel there are many more examples where the state has chose to maintain the old laws/stances that can easily be shown to be unhelpful and sometimes detrimental to the population. These problems can be fixed but only through the election of members of the society that want to see the state flourish and not members who want a career and a paycheck.",1,Alabama,9,10,2,White,4,2,0,0

There are points in time in which the residents make you feel bad for asking them to do their jobs. There are little to no expectations for improvement and if any are brought up, the entire idea of ""change"" causes ignorant hysteria.  I hate to be the person who brings up COVID, but there were times when every one of my friends and I had emailed the president separately with constructive criticism. It feels as if the reputation within these communities and its image is more important than the actual significance of what each decision means for the people living there. For instance, while police are handing out tickets to students on the strip left and right for not wearing masks, perhaps instead of targeting a very financially, emotionally, and mentally stressed demographic of college students, it would be smarter and more efficient to close down University Dr. (which is easily done on game days) and allow restaurants and bars to seat people outside or in the street? As I mentioned, there is no authentic concern for students or our wellbeing, what's important is that it looks like there is a concern to bystanders. Things seem to be handed to residents in Alabama compared to in other states where there are certifications and training involved. For instance, the process of acquiring one's driver's license is little to none here in Alabama, whereas in Illinois you have to not only take a driving class but also have a permit for lots of time and pass a written and driving exam. The difference in driving on the road is extremely noticeable in these two different states, as well as the overall attitudes of the people and their different rates of innovation as a result of their lower or higher expectations for their community members.

Thatâ€™s something I would apply to the city of New York, and LA as well. More than just an issue with Alabama Iâ€™d say that political polarization is something that is plaguing the US as a whole. Iâ€™d love to see a nice skate park, a Trader Joeâ€™s, maybe even a vegan restaurant in Tuscaloosa! Even unique landmarks and bridges, (on a larger scale than Vulcan) could help with retention, being a state where locals can be tourists!! A large amusement park, could be such a hoot!! Iâ€™d love to see more emphasis on hiking and the outdoors from a ~granola-sunny-day-hiker~ Standpoint and less marketing in the hunting industry (which I acknowledge is pretty integral to society and the market here, it is in TN too). I donâ€™t want Alabama to be a majorly liberal state, but I think the openness and outspoken support of gay communities, artists, folk and indie music is attractive to young people. Itâ€™s why I believe North Carolina and Texas have had such success with their retention and population. They have cities like Asheville, Raleigh, Charleston as well as Austin and Houston. I think from a marketing standpoint Alabama should focus on bringing in new and improved â€œstate-of-the-artâ€ facilities, venues, architecture, and gardens. Instead of focusing on the history and how far weâ€™ve come (which is still very important to acknowledge), taking an approach to enjoy the natural beauty of the state and visit newly built interesting places would draw a lot of people to want to come and then stay here. Another VERY large factor is the job market here is not fantastic, but more so than that is the transportation here isnâ€™t connected to a lot of other cities. I think it would benefit the state enormously would be to help finance a connection of the High-speed railway in the US starting in Mobile/Gulf Shores and moving upward into Montgomery, then to Birmingham, with possible stops or small scale connectors to Auburn and Tuscaloosa and then have a central Alabama station to take a train up through Nashville with a fairly straight shot to Chicago or take the route NE through TN Smokey mountain area (Chattanooga, Knoxville, Bristol) to connect to the railway already existing in Washington DC. I believe if Alabama were to really push for those improvements that many more people would attend university here and stay because it would be fairly connected to the rest of the US. It would increase school attendance and tourism for the entire state. I love Alabama, but Iâ€™m some aspects it is just very out of the loop. I would like to return because of the beautiful weather and nice people, but the lack of connectivity and major industry and even visual/physical investment  in the people and public facilities (besides the university of Alabama, which basically funds itself) makes it hard to want to stay. However, the emphasis on pulling intelligent students here with fantastic academic scholarships has definitely decreased the evident emigration and brain drain the state is experiencing. My dads family has lived all across Alabama for such a long time, so I do have sentimental investment, and thatâ€™s why I believe the state could be such a wonderful place for growing industries and younger populations and families!",,Tennessee,3,,1,White,4,2,0,0

Instead of addressing core issues, government continues to modernize/build new places to live and shop and eat instead of focusing on rebuilding/preserving efforts. Some parts of the state are so poor and they receive little to no help. Segregation is alive and well in parts of the state. There are opportunities for growth, but only for the middle class and up. The progression which strikes the rest of the world seems dead to Alabama. The natural environment is disappointing considering it is so beautiful but constantly littered and the park costs continue to rise because preservation is not a concern to Alabama government. The public school education is immeasurably disappointing and continues to be so despite the passing years. The rampant drug problems are never dealt with, as the government would rather throw people in prison than offer effective rehabilitation programs. New private prisons are still being built despite local objections, only in poor counties where the unsightly can be hidden away. Take Brierfield for example. The grandfather system is alive and well in Alabama. From cops to judges, no amount of corruption seems enough to get fired. Itâ€™s practically free reign.  I will be leaving as soon as possible in hopes of better lands. ",1,Alabama,9,3,1,White,4,2,0,0

I have interacted with state legislatures on several occasions and they always ask for young people to stay in the state. We donâ€™t and wonâ€™t stay for multiple reasons. There are little to no prospects, career or otherwise, in this state. The social atmosphere is incredibly hateful. State leadership has made it very clear that they do not respect and except diversity. They have repeatedly attacked womenâ€™s health, the LGBTQ community, communities of color, specifically black communities, and are incapable of separating their own personal religions beliefs from governance. Being an Alabamian is EMBARRASSING. A football coach with zero experience or qualifications is our senator. We have conspiracy theorist that insight insurrection as a representative (Mo Brooks). Alabama is a joke, to the people who live here, the country, and the world. I would love to stay here and see this states potential realized and be someone who can help with that. However, I am not sure this state will welcome the type of skills I can offer. Iâ€™m also not sure I want to spend my life fighting the ignorance when I could be helping more people elsewhere.

While I do care about and love many people here, the growing aura of close-mindedness in Alabama disheartening. Also, the brazen lack of care for the environment is disgusting. Most roads are sprayed with pesticides on a weekly basis, without any care for the potential health affects this may cause. Also the blatant disregard for many public safety measures is just unacceptable. Alabama has decided to let itself become a state that is influenced by the close-minded beliefs of certain individuals in the state. Instead of striving to become a leader in health, technology, or any other field, Alabama has decided to make itself a refuge for those who wish to deny others their rights, or reject reality as a whole.
